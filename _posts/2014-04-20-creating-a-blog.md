title: Creating a blog

It seems all the cool kids have one, at least those calling themselves data scientists, so I thought it time I started one for myself.

I like the idea of keeping this all as text files with free hosting so when I came across [this](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) blog post I thought I'd give it a go.

The site is hosted on [github](www.github.com/tomwright01) which uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to convert [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) files to html. A bunch of templates are provided from [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which saves me from having to make it look pretty myself.

Setup was pretty straight forward, examine my [commit log](https://github.com/tomwright01/Blog/commits/gh-pages) to see my mistakes.
