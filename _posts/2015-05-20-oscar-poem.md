# A Poem by Oscar*

tinkle tinkle little bat
wonder where the potty at,

straight ahead or to the right,
caves are very dark at night,

little bat why do you frown?
    did you tinkle upsidedown?

* so a quick search on Google reveals that perhaps this wasn't as original as I was lead to believe. In fact the author of this little ditty was Dianne Rowley and it was originally published in "Peter Peter Pizza-Eater" by Meadowbrook Press.
